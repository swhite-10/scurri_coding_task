During my tenure at the Central Bank of Ireland, I developed an Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRBB) risk quantification model using R, which was a significant improvement on existing risk quantification/challenge tools. This model helped the Central Bank to identify and monitor potential risks associated with changes in interest rates across institutions under its supervision, which is a critical aspect of financial stability. I am proud of this achievement because it required a deep understanding of the banking system, financial modeling, and programming skills to develop a reliable tool that could be used to make informed decisions. Furthermore, the successful implementation of this model demonstrated my ability to tackle complex technical problems and make a positive impact in a highly challenging environment.
