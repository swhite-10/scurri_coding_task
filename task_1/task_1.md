#### Tell us about one thing you are proud of in your career. It could be a difficult technical problem you had to solve in your work or a personal project. There is no need to go into details; a short paragraph explaining the problem and why you are proud of it would be fine.

During my tenure at the Central Bank of Ireland, I developed an Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) risk quantification model using R, which was a significant improvement on existing risk quantification/challenge tools. This model helped the Central Bank to identify and monitor potential risks associated with changes in interest rates across institutions under its supervision, which is a critical aspect of financial stability. I am proud of this achievement because it required a deep understanding of the banking system, financial modeling, and programming skills to develop a reliable tool that could be used to make informed decisions. Furthermore, the successful implementation of this model demonstrated my ability to tackle complex technical problems and make a positive impact in a highly challenging environment.
